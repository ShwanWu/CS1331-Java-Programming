This game of Battleship involves two players that are trying to sink each other’s ships. Each player has a grid of their current hits, misses and unguessed squares. Players take turns in guessing locations on the opposing player’s board on where they think a boat is. Depending on that guess and the locations of the ships, the attempt can be a hit or a miss. In our version of Battleship, each player has only one shot (guess) per turn and even if it’s a successful hit, that player’s turn ends. The game ends when a player has successfully hit all of their opponent’s ships.
