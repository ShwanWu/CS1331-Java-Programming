This is a word guess game:
Game Play Rules
As long as the player has made fewer than five misses and has not guessed all the letters in the word:
1. Print a line reporting the current missed letters and the number of remaining misses before the player loses.
2. Print a line reporting the current guess with underscores, '_', for letters which haven’t yet been guessed.
3. Print a prompt for the user to enter a letter on the same line as the prompt.
4. Read a letter from the console.
5. Update the current guess and the number of misses accordingly.
Print a line reporting all the letters the player missed in the game.
Print a line reporting the final guess, including '_' characters for letters that weren’t guessed.
If the player lost, print a line saying “Sorry, too many missess.” and what the secret word was.
If the player won, print a line saying “Congratulations! You got it!” (the full secret word will have already been printed).
